<p align="center"><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xukay101/cardiac-emulator-python/master/demo.gif' /></p>

This is a Python implementation of an emulator for the CARDIAC (Cardboard Illustrative Aid to Computation) computer, a teaching tool designed by David Hagelbarger in the late 1960s.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.7 or higher.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Xukay101/cardiac-emulator-python.git
```

2. Install the project dependencies with the following command:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the emulator, follow these steps:
1. Run the `app.py` file in the command line:
```
$ python app.py
```
2. The graphical user interface of the emulator will open.
3. Load the program you want to run in the corresponding cells by entering the opcode and address in the corresponding text boxes.
4. Enter the input data (if any) on the input card by entering the numbers in the appropriate text box and clicking the `add` button.
5. Enter the entry point of the program in the `Target` text field. The entry point refers to the memory address where the program starts.
6. Click on the `step` or `run` button to run the program. Outputs will be shown on the output card.
